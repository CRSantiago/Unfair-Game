The task is to form two teams for a strategic battle game, with a total of 2000 players. One of the teams, consisting of Team Captain A and 999 other players, has already been formed. 
Team Captain B is a new person who just moved into town and doesn't know anyone's strengths and weaknesses. However, Team Captain A knows everyone and their strengths and weaknesses.

The objective of Team Captain A is to use this knowledge to choose the best players for their team and defeat Team Captain B's team. 
The selection process is to be done by both team captains, and the algorithm used for the selection process is not specified, but the prompt mentions that there is a program that uses quicksort.
